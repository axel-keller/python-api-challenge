# python-api-challenge
Module 6 Challenge 
Used started code for both the Weather and Vacation py.
Used the openweather documentation 
Used geoapify documentation 
For my hvplot visuals, they work in jupyter notebook but are not displaying in GitHub, I asked Xpert Learning Assistant and told me to take screenshots of both the total cities and cities with hotels. For the cities with hotels, the code specifies what to show when hovered over.
